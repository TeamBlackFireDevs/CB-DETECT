**üåê CBDetect: Cyberbullying Detection with Machine Learning**

CBDetect is a machine learning-based solution designed to detect instances of cyberbullying on social media platforms. This project aims to promote a safer online environment by identifying harmful language and abusive content.

This project successfully implemented a model for detecting cyberbullying on Twitter by employing two popular machine learning techniques: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system was trained to classify tweets as either offensive (hate speech) or non-offensive, and its performance was evaluated using several metrics, including precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. Both models demonstrated their effectiveness in classifying hate speech, with the SVM model slightly outperforming Naive Bayes in precision-based tasks, while Naive Bayes was quicker and computationally efficient.
